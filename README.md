## How we fulfilled the requirements

Our friend Joshua Nimella made KUcourses.dk and gave us acces to the api at:

- [] [Create](https://kucourses.dk/api/index.html.),

Using this we made the SQL database
with databasefiles/initialize database.py that called the api. We had to split the
api calls in two, as to not get ratelimited. We then exported the tables from
pgadmin into csv files, which is what is in the git.
For the admissions table we used:

- [] [Create](https://www.ku.dk/studier/bachelor/statistik-og-tal/),

optagelsesstatistik-2024. We coped all the the text with control c, and then
formatted it into a csv file with some python code.
